	<h1> As We May Think </h1>

	<h2> Vannevar Bush, July 1945 </h2>

	<h3> "The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships."  </h3>
</p>

	<h4> "All our steps in creating or absorbing material of the record proceed through one of the sensesâ€”the tactile when we touch keys, the oral when we speak or listen, the visual when we read. Is it not possible that some day the path may be established more directly?" </h4>

<h7> Long Live the Web </h7>

<h8> Tim Berners Lee </h8>

<h9> Universality </h9>

<h10> You can put anything on the web, no matter what computer you have, software you use or human language you speak and regardless of you have wireless or wire Internet connection </h10>

<h11> Decentralization </h11>

<h12> You do not need an approval from central authority to create a page </h12>

<h13> Internet vs Web </h13>

<h14> Internet is an electricity network while a web is a home appliance </h14>

<h15> Net Neutrality </h15>

<h16> You should get a quality of Internet connection you paid for </h16>
